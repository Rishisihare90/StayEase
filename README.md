# StayEase ‚Äì Full-Stack Hotel Booking Platform

## About the Project

**StayEase** is a full-stack hotel booking platform designed to provide a seamless experience for both customers and administrators. The application features a secure, stateless RESTful API built with Spring Boot, which powers a responsive user interface created with React.

The core of the system is a real-time room availability search engine, allowing users to find and book rooms based on their travel dates. The platform enforces a robust security model with role-based access control and handles payments securely via the Stripe API.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or later

### 2. Setup Backend

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd spring-backend
    ```
2.  **Create your configuration file**:
    - Inside the `src/main/resources/` directory, create a new file named `application.properties`.
3.  **Copy the template**:
    - Open `application-example.properties`, copy all of its content, and paste it into your new `application.properties` file.
4.  **Configure your secrets**:
    - In the **new `application.properties` file**, update the `spring.datasource.url`, `spring.datasource.username`, and `spring.datasource.password` to match your local MySQL setup.
    - Set a long, random string for your `secreteJwtString` property.
    - Add your Stripe API keys.
5.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend server will start on `http://localhost:9090`.

### 3. Setup Frontend

1.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../react-frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The React application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
